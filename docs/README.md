## About Me
I am an Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Masters student at the University of Connecticut. I also completed my undergraduate studies at UConn, working in the [Klassen lab](https://www.jonathanklassenlab.com/) where I researched pathogenic fungi within the attini ant-fungi symbiosis.

Currently, I am working in the [Dagilis lab](https://adagilis.github.io/) focusing on the pathogenic fungus responsible for White-Nose Bat Syndrome (_Pseudogymnoascus destructans_) utilizing population genetics.
